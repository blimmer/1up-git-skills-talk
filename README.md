# 1-Up Your Git Skills

In this talk, I present the two main schools of thought on git commit history. We also talk in-depth about the three PR merge options in the GitHub interface (merge, squash & merge, rebase & merge) in detail.

This presentation was created with [reveal-ck](https://github.com/jedcn/reveal-ck).

## Slides

You can view the slides [here](https://blimmer.github.io/1up-git-skills-talk), or on [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/BenLimmer/1up-your-git-skills).

## Original Version

This is a revamped version of a talk I gave in 2015. If you want to view that
talk, please check out the [v1 branch](https://github.com/blimmer/1up-git-skills-talk/tree/v1).

The first version walks through a lot more of the specifics of local rebasing and squashing.
If you don't use GitHub, or want to dive deeper on how to squash / rebase locally, check it out.

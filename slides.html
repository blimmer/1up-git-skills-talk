<p>We'll stick mostly to using porcelain commands, but reading the

<h1>A Tale of Two Histories</h1>

</section>
<section>

<h2>Two main schools of thought on commit history</h2>

</section>
<section>

<h2>School 0:</h2>

<h3>"It's a record of what actually happened"</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s a historical document, valuable in its own right, and shouldn’t be tampered with. From this angle, changing the commit history is almost blasphemous; you’re lying about what actually transpired. So what if there was a messy series of merge commits? That’s how it happened, and the repository should preserve that for posterity.</p>

<p>Some of these are, of course, shown in jest and the commit messages could be
improved.</p>

<p class="fragment">
This really <strong>is</strong> a record of exactly what happened.
</p>

<p class="fragment">
However, the historical record can be difficult to traverse.
</p>

</section>
<section>

<h2>School 1:</h2>

<h3>"It's the story of how your project was made"</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>You wouldn’t publish the first draft of a book, and the manual for how to maintain your software deserves careful editing. This is the camp that uses tools like rebase and filter-branch to tell the story in the way that’s best for future readers.</p>

<h1>School 1</h1>

</section>
<section>

<h2>School 0</h2>

<h3>"It's a record of what actually happened"</h3>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Easy</li>
<li>Low-Risk / Barrier to Entry</li>
<li>History records what "really happened"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lots of micro-commits, with varying levels of meaning</li>
<li>More commits === more time spelunking the logs</li>
</ul>

</section>

<h2>School 1</h2>

<h3>"It's the story of how your project was made"</h3>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Clean, meaningful history</li>
<li>No "WIP", "Initial", etc. commits</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>More time-consuming</li>
<li>Must be careful with rewriting history</li>
<li>Can create very "macro" commits containing a lot of code</li>

<h2>on the two schools ?</h2>

</section>
<section>
<section>

<p>I, personally, believe in School 1.
</p>
<p class="fragment">
But we need to understand what it means to "rebase" before we go any further.
</p>

</section>
<section>

<h2>Merge vs. Rebase</h2>

</section>
<section>

<h2>Merge</h2>

<p>A merge occurs when you want to integrate two branches together.
<img src="images/networks/merge-1.png" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section>

<p>When you merge <code>experiment</code> into <code>master</code>, it performs a three-way merge between
the two latest branch snapshots (C3 and C4) and the most recent common ancestor
of the two (C2), creating a new snapshot (and commit).
<img src="images/networks/merge-2.png" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section>

<p>This is fine, but we've produced another commit which might not be extremely
valuable.</p>

</section>
<section>

<h2>Rebase</h2>

<p>A rebase takes one or more patches and reapplies it on top of new commits on
the destination branch.
<img src="images/networks/merge-1.png" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section>

<p>When you rebase <code>experiment</code> off of <code>master</code>, it works by going to the common
ancestor of the two branches (C2), generating diffs for each subsequent commit
(C4), and applies the commit to the new commit on <code>master</code>.
<img src="images/networks/rebase-1.png" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section>

<p>Now we can fast-forward merge to <code>master</code>, giving us
<img src="images/networks/rebase-2.png" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section>

<p>The result of the merge and the rebase are functionally the same, except the
rebase history looks more linear.</p>

<h2>on basic rebasing ?</h2>

</section>
<section>
<section>

<p>But how does this get rid of "meaningless" commits?
</p>
<p class="fragment">
It doesn't directly, but an interactive rebase does.
</p>

</section>
<section>

<h2>Interactive Rebasing</h2>

<p>Allows you to "edit" each commit's contents or message as you re-apply each commit
on top of the ancestor branch.</p>

</section>
<section>

<p>While working on a feature branch, you likely have a commit history like this</p>

<p><img src="images/commits/record-5.png" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section>

<p>However, <strong>very</strong> little actually changed for this feature.</p>

<p><img src="images/commits/record-6.png" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section>

<p>Imagine bisecting this and finding that this was the offending commit</p>

<p><img src="images/commits/record-7.png" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section>

<h1><img class="emoji" alt=":rage:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f621.png"></h1>

</section>
<section>

<p>In the example above, there were two problems (IMO):</p>

<ol>
<li>There are a lot of commits retaining history that isn't important to maintain
(e.g. fixing specs and making PR notes)</li>
<li>The dev originally branched off of develop, but then merged develop back in.
In total, that means that for this work, there will be two merge commits that
don't mean a lot.</li>
</ol>

</section>
<section>

<p>How do we fix it?</p>

</section>
<section>

<h2>Interactive Rebase</h2>

<p>Before merging the feature into develop, the dev could have done an interactive
rebase in order to "squash" commits.</p>

</section>
<section>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout feature/x
git rebase develop
</code></pre>
</section>
<section>

<p>This brings you to a screen where you can decide what to do with your commits</p>

<p><img src="images/rebase-tutorial/rebase-1.png" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section>

<h2>Squash (allthethings)</h2>

<p>In this example, I want to squash everything down to 1 commit because that's
the only valuable history on this branch.</p>

<p><img src="images/rebase-tutorial/rebase-2.png" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section>

<h2>Reword Commit <code>r</code>
</h2>

<p>Since I said I wanted to reword the first commit, I'm brought to this screen</p>

<p><img src="images/rebase-tutorial/rebase-3.png" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section>

<h2>Complete Rebase</h2>

<p>Now that I've reworded, I'm shown a final summary of happened</p>

<p><img src="images/rebase-tutorial/rebase-4.png" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section>

<h2><img class="emoji" alt=":tada:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png"></h2>

<p>We're left with one meaningful commit message!</p>

</section>
<section>
<section>

<h1><img class="emoji" alt=":ambulance:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f691.png"></h1>

<p>When re-writing history (e.g. rebasing) can go wrong</p>

</section>
<section>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Imagine I'm working on a feature branch and it has 3 commits on origin (meaning
I've pushed the branch to GitHub).</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Commit Hash</th>
<th>Message</th>
<th>Author</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>a</td>
<td>Initial Implementation</td>
<td>blimmer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>b</td>
<td>Test Fixes</td>
<td>blimmer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>c</td>
<td>PR Updates</td>
<td>blimmer</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</section>
<section>

<p>I decide to rebase those commits into one commit. However, the designer on my
team has checked out my feature branch, added a commit, and pushed it to origin,
so the history on origin looks like this.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Commit Hash</th>
<th>Message</th>
<th>Author</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>a</td>
<td>Initial Implementation</td>
<td>blimmer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>b</td>
<td>Test Fixes</td>
<td>blimmer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>c</td>
<td>PR Updates</td>
<td>blimmer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>d</td>
<td>Fonts &amp; Colors</td>
<td>krsmcd</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</section>
<section>

<p>However, if I don't pull from origin first, do an interactive rebase to squash
my three commits into one, and force-push to origin, origin will now have this
history.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Commit Hash</th>
<th>Message</th>
<th>Author</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>f</td>
<td>My Squashed Commit</td>
<td>blimmer</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</section>
<section>

<p>Doh! I just lost the designer's commit. Let's hope he still has that commit
locally so we can do some git-fu to get it back.</p>

<p><img class="emoji" alt=":facepunch:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44a.png"></p>

</section>
<section>

<p>There are two things to take from this accident.</p>

<ol>
<li>If you know others are (or even might be) working on your branch, don't
rewrite history until you're ready to merge.</li>
<li>
<strong>always</strong> use <code>--force-with-lease</code> to ensure your local remote ref is the
same as the origin remote ref (e.g. no one else has pushed commits to your branch)</li>
</ol>

</section>
<section>

<p>If I would have used</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">git push --force-with-lease
</code></pre>
<p>I would have seen this message</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">git push --force-with-lease
To /tmp/repo
[rejected]  feature/x -&gt; feature/x (stale info)
error: failed to push some refs to '/tmp/repo'
</code></pre>
<p>That would have told me - oh crap, someone else was working on this branch!</p>

</section>
<section>

<p>Ok, it sounds scary but it's really not that bad. 9/10 times I'm working on my
own on a branch. If I'm not, I just wait to do any rebasing until I'm ready to
merge to develop.</p>

</section>
<section>

<h2>Git Flow ... kinda</h2>

<p class="fragment">
Kinda, because most of us don't use the git flow plugin.
</p>

<p class="fragment">
But, from a high level, we have 3-4 kinds of branches.
</p>

</section>
<section>

<h2>master</h2>

<h3>a.k.a. the "release branch"</h3>

</section>
<section>

<h2>master rules</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Never</strong> rebased</li>
<li>Tests always pass</li>
<li>Tagged with a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/">GitHub Release</a> when deploying to prod</li>
<li>Only branched directly for hotfixes</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>

<h2>master benefits</h2>

<ul>
<li>Allows develop to be in a <strong>semi</strong>-releasable state, with ability to hotfix emergencies</li>
<li>Tags allow simple history (<a href="https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator">changelog generator</a>)</li>
</ul>

</section>

<h2>develop</h2>

<h3>a.k.a. the "next release" branch</h3>

</section>

<li>Semi-stable</li>
<li>Tests should pass</li>
<li>Features/Epics are merged here</li>
</ul>

</section>

<h2>develop benefits</h2>

<ul>
<li>Allows us to build up the next release without dealing with merge conflicts right before deploy</li>
<li>Easily aggregate changes before a deploy</li>
</ul>

<h2>feature branch benefits</h2>

<ul>
<li>Comfortably rebase when you want</li>
<li>WIP commits OK (will be squashed before merging)</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>

<h2>epic branches</h2>

<h3>a.k.a. a "collection of story branches" that might take more than a sprint to get deployable</h3>

</section>
<section>

<h2>epic branch rules</h2>

<ul>
<li>Not rebased (until ready for merge to develop)</li>
<li>Merged into occasionally from develop (if develop is active)</li>
<li>Related feature branches are branched from the epic branch</li>
<li>Simply "another develop", but shorter lived</li>
